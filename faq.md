# Frequently Asked Questions

#### How to submit an answer?

Within each exercise notebook, on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/iqc2021), you will find guidelines to submit an answer. For example in exercise 1 notebook:

```python
# Check your answer using following code
from qc_grader import grade_ex1
grade_ex1(qc)
```

```python
# Submit your answer. You can re-submit at any time.
from qc_grader import submit_ex1
submit_ex1(qc)
```

#### Can I run the exercise notebooks on a local computer?

Yes it is possible. But we strongly recommend you to solve the exercises on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/iqc2021). If you really want to run the exercises locally, you can download the notebooks from the [challenge repository](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-2021) and run using Jupyter notebook.

#### Can we check answers on a local computer?

Yes it is possible. But similar to the above question, we strongly recommend you to solve the exercises and check answers on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/iqc2021). If you really want to check answers on a local computer, you need to install the [grading client](https://github.com/qiskit-community/Quantum-Challenge-Grader) in addition to downloading the notebooks.

#### Do we need to download the notebooks from github?

No , you can run all exercises on the [challenge portal](http://ibm.co/iqc2021) itself.

#### Do I need to take the exercises in order?

We encourage you to take the exercises in the given order to fall along the theme of 5 important milestones in the history of quantum computing - as the exercises are arranged in chronological order of the discovery of a given milestone. However, you may take the exercises in any order - keeping in mind that you need to solve at least one exercise before getting special access for exercise 4.

#### What is the range of  “estimated time to complete”?

The “estimated time to complete” varies depending on the knowledge and experience of an individual participant. It is given to provide a sense of relative difficulty among the exercises.

#### Is “estimated time to complete” the max time limit to attempt the problem? After that we can't submit? How does it work?

There isn’t a max time limit to attempt a given problem. You may submit answers to any of the 5 exercises at any time before the Challenge ends. The Challenge ends at *9 PM EDT, 26 May, 2021* - after which no answers will be accepted.

#### I encountered “Server error”. What should I do?

We have a lot of participants at the moment. Please be patient, wait and try again.

#### I encountered this error “401 : Unauthorized You are not Authenticated to do this (1)” What should I do?

We have a lot of participants at the moment. Please be patient, wait and try again.
